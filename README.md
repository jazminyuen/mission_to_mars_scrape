# Mission to Mars

## Project Overview

Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate a web browser to scrape website for data about the Mission to Mars, I have stored the data in a MongoDB database and created a web application with Flask to display the data. 

Resources also include Python, Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, and HTML with Bootstrap components.
